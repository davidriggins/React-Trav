

- Create a React app without installation of tool
	npx create-react-app <app-name>

- To start
	npm start

- Index.js is generally entry point for react.
- App.js is the root component.

- Uses JSX
	- Some differences:
		- Can't use "class", use "className"
		- Can't user "for", user "htmlFor"
		
- Shortcut to create boiler plate of a component (with extension installed):
	rafce <tab>
	- creates this:
	
	import React from 'react';

	const Header = () => {
		return <div>Header</div>;
	};

	export default Header;

	- Don't need the import line anymore, so you can delete it.

- Create the component, import it, and embed it.
