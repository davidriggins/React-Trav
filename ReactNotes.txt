

- Create a React app without installation of tool
	npx create-react-app <app-name>

- To start
	npm start

- Index.js is generally entry point for react.
- App.js is the root component.

- Uses JSX
	- Some differences:
		- Can't use "class", use "className"
		- Can't user "for", user "htmlFor"
		
- Shortcut to create boiler plate of a component (with extension installed):
	rafce <tab>
	- creates this:
	
	import React from 'react';

	const Header = () => {
		return <div>Header</div>;
	};

	export default Header;

	- Don't need the import line anymore, so you can delete it.

- Create the component, import it, and embed it.

- You can pass props to the component:

	<Header title="Whatever">
	
	- And in the component add props as an argument and reference
	  the item you want:
	  
	const Header = (props) => {
	    return (
			<header>
				<h1>{props.title}</h1>
			</header>
		);
	};
	
- You can also specify default prop values as such:

	Header.defaultProps = {
		title: 'Task Tracker',
	};
	
- You can destructure the props as such:

	({ title })
	
	and then reference it by title instead of props.title
